# anki-save-words

A useful extension to use in conjunction with Anki.app (free) flashcard software

A small google chrome extension to be used with Google Translate in the chrome browser. This extension allows you to quickly copy both your input text e.g. text in your native language that you want translated, and its translation. 

These words or phrases are written into a seperate tab in your browser on the click of a button.

Then with a list of words and phrases in both your input and target language you can add them to a simple text file and import them directly into one of your personal Anki decks.
